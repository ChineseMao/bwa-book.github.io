The announcement that Apple had been working on a watch that could respond to voice commands and also run apps and communicate with the Internet via an iPhone set the Mac and iOS developer community alight. Not only did it signal the potential for yet another app gold rush, but it tickled the imaginations of those former children for whom the wristwatch was the perfect device on which to control your digital life.

Sure, the iPhone was revolutionary, but it was still just a phone, and we’ve always had phones (depending on your age, of course). The iPad has changed the face of personal computing, but it’s still just a computer, albeit a lot smaller than the ones we had when we were kids.

The Apple Watch is different. We never needed the other devices in the same way that we wanted the ability to talk to our watches. We dreamed of being able to tap the watch face and have it respond to the commands. We yearned for the day that critical information would arrive directly to our wrists.
